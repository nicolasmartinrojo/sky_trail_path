We have a Ski trail that goes from "start" to a possible end(END_1 or END_2). There're a few different paths, defined on the time_waste array and there's a score for each checkpoint defined on the checkpoints array

Find the best possible path. Path meaning the addition of the scores from the checkpoints of the path and the subtraction of the time wasted between the two points.

I.E.: A possible path can be START,A,D,F,END_1. The score is 38 and the wasted time is 17 so the final score is 21
